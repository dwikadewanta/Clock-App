## Project Description 📜
Clock App is a simple clock mobile application with various time-related features, such as an alarm, stopwatch, and timer. The user interface (UI) design is inspired by the system clock application on Android MIUI 13.0.1, with slight modifications to the components and available features. Feature additions and UI design changes may still be made in future projects.
